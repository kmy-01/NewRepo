### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/kmy-01/NewRepo/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.

### Header 3 uses 3 Hash
- Bullet points use dash
- Second bullet point
